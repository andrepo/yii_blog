Yii 2 - Sample Blog Project
============================

This is a demo project I've built while learning Yii 2 and to showcase my programming skills. 

The project contains the basic features including user login/logout and a contact page.

features to your application.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

The minimum requirement by this project template that your Web server supports PHP 5.4.0.


INSTALLATION
------------

Check out this repo using git to a folder of your choise. 

Set cookie validation key in `config/web.php` file to some random secret string:

```php
'request' => [
    // !!! insert a secret key in the following (if it is empty) - this is required by cookie validation
    'cookieValidationKey' => '<secret random string goes here>',
],
```

You can then access the application through the following URL:

~~~
http://localhost/[folder of choice]/web/
~~~


### Install required vendor libs via Composer

If you do not have [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), you may install it by following the instructions
at [getcomposer.org](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-nix).

You can then install this project required libs using the following command:

~~~
php composer.phar install"
~~~


CONFIGURATION
-------------

### Database

Edit the file `config/db.php` with real data, for example:

```php
return [
    'class' => 'yii\db\Connection',
    'dsn' => 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=yii_blog',
    'username' => 'root',
    'password' => '1234',
    'charset' => 'utf8',
];
```

**NOTE:** Yii won't create the database for you, this has to be done manually before you can access it.

Also check and edit the other files in the `config/` directory to customize your application.

The required tables and sql skeleton can be found under db/mysql_dump.sql
